I am a Phd candidate at the <b>University of Warwick</b>. My research interests focus on <b>International Trade</b>, <b>Enviromental Economics</b>, and <b>Urban Economics</b>. In particular, I am interested in studying how transports shape economic activities across countries. I am also an academic visitor at the Bank of England since September 2022.
