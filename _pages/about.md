<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Phd candidate at the <b>University of Warwick</b>. My research interests focus on <b>International Trade</b>, <b>Enviromental Economics</b>, and <b>Urban Economics</b>. In particular, I am interested in studying how transportation shapes economic activities across countries. I have also been an academic visitor at the Bank of England from September 2022 to July 2024.
